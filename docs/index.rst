Donnie is an assistive technology project, whose objective is to use robotics to facilitate programming teaching to visually impaired students.
It is divided in two main parts:

- The construction and fine-tuning of the titular mobile robot, Donnie;
- The project's software stack, including an intuitive parser/interpreter and a robot simulation environment;

The project is in its second version, developed in the Laborat贸rio de Sistemas Aut么nomos (LSA_) of the Pontific Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS), Brazil.
