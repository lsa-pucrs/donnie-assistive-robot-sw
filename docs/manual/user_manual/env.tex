\section{Custom Environments}
\label{sec:envs}

The user can extend both the simulated and the actual robot environments.

\subsection{Building New Virtual Environments}

New simulation environments can be easily created with the help of \href{http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/?src=stage}{Stage}.
Please refer to \href{https://github.com/jennyhasahat/Player-Stage-Manual}{Jenny's Player/Stage tutorial} to learn how to create a robot and an environment with Player/Stage. 

\subsection{Building a New Real Environment}

We recommend to use Donnie robot in controlled environment, specially because of the its computer vision 
features which can have poor performance in a uncontrolled environment.
For this reason we recomment maze-like envionments with opaque collors (with low reflex) to work with Donnie.

We provided STL files of modular wall designs for the ones with access to Laser Cutting facility.
These walls have 40 cm of height, to block Donnie's view from the uncontrolled environment.
These modular walls can be used to build envirinments like the ones illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:maze}.
