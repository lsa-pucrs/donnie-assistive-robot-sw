\section{Donnie's Use Cases}
\label{sec:user_case}

Donnie can be used in two modes: with a simulated robot and with the actual robot.
So, if you still donâ€™t have your Donnie robot, you can start using the simulation environment.


\section{Simulating Donnie}
\label{sec:sim}

\subsection{Virtual Machine}

\subsection{Pre-Built Software}

\subsection{Compiling the Software}

\subsection{Launch the Simulation Environment}

There are some pre-built simulation environments to start testing Donnie.
Copy the following files to a local directory

DONNIE\_PATH/sssssss

Execute the command cccccc.


\section{Using the Actual Donnie Robot}
\label{sec:robot}

The setup to use the robot is to the setup for simulation, except for few additional steps described below.
