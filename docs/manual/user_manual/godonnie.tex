\chapter{GoDonnie}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:godonnie_intro}

This part of the manual is required only if the reader wants to learn the GoDonnie language. 

\subsection{Why to Build GoDonnie}

GoDonnie has been built to teach the basics of programming for people with normal sight, visual impairment, or blind.
GoDonnie is heavily inspired by Logo ....

{\ TODO}

Once the student dominates the GoDonnie language, he can migrate to more advanced languages such as Python, C, Java, etc. 
All these languages are also supported by the robotic middlewares (Player and ROS) so the transition of languages comes quite naturally, without changing the underlying Donnie's software stack.
