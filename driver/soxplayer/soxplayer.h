 @brief Player driver for LibSoX

The soxplayer driver receives the filename of an audio file supported by LibSoX 
and plays it. It can also apply sox effects such as speed, tempo, pitch. 
Refer to www.libsox.org to check the other available effects.

@par Compile-time dependencies

- libsox (sudo apt-get install libsox-dev)

@par Provides

- @ref interface_playsound

@par Requires

- none

@par Configuration requests

- none

@par Configuration file options

- speed (float)
  - Apply the 'speed' sox effect to control the sound speed
  - Default: 1
  - fast <1; slow >1 

- pitch (float)
  - Apply the 'pitch' sox effect to control the sound pitch
  - Default: ???
  - ????

- tempo (float)
 - Apply the 'tempo' sox effect to control the sound tempo
 - Default: 1
 - fast >1; slow <1  

@par Example

@verbatim
driver
(
	name "soxplayer"
	plugin "libsoxplayer"
	provides ["playsound:0"]
)
@endverbatim

@todo
- define the range for the configuration parameters
