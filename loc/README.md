# Localization Files

This package supports language localization in US english and BR portuguese.
The translation files found here were generated using the [_gettext_](http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) package.
To select the language, set the environmental variable _DONNIE_LANG_ to either "en_US" or "pt_BR".

## Disclaimer

- **Do not remove this folder from the repository's root directory**. The translator environment in the different modules expect the files to be located here.
- This is a work in progress. Feel free to open issues regarding errors in localization (e.g. mistranslations, missing terms).
